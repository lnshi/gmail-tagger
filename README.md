## Why build this extension?
- Lets say you got 50 email conversations in your inbox in one page, though perhaps all emails have its own title:
  - It is still a bit hard to just take a glance to find out the exact conversation you are looking for.
  - Some email titles are not that accurate to you.
  - You want to remark or add a quick tag(note) to one email, for you can find this exact email in future in one second.

- This extension is for solving the above problems, for you to use 'Gmail' more efficiently and more conveniently through the following way:
  - Allow you to tag your Gmail inbox email conversations as you wish.
  - Sync your tags data according to your Gmail account, so you can see them on any other PC.
