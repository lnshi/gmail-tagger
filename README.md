## Why build this extension?

- Lets say you got 50 emails in your inbox in one page, though perhaps all emails have its own title:

  - It is still a bit hard to just take a glance to find out the exact conversation you are looking for.

  - Some email titles are not that explicit to you.

  - You want to remark or add a quick tag(note) to one email, so in the future you can know what you had planned to this email by just taking a glance.

- This extension is for solving the above problems, for you to use Gmail more efficiently.
